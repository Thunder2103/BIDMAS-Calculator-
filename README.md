# BIDMAS-Calculator-

A BIDMAS calculator with a GUI - created using python and tkinter (a built in library no extra download needed)  
Indices have not been included but I plan to add them in the future. 

I attempted to incorporate software development methodologies such as DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and commenting less as in previous posts I put in too many comments to explain the program. I also expanded my knowledge on in-built python functions during this project.

Due to the large amount of combinations of numbers and operators I can't test for everything, it would be greatly appreciated if people could test this and report any errors so they can be fixed 

I've been unexpectedly busy with work over the summer so this project is all I've had time to work on but I'm pleased with the result. 



Update 1: 07/09/2021 fixed an issue that causes 0's to not merge properly causing syntax errors.  

05/07/2023: If it wasn't obvious by the near two years of inactivity this repository will no longer be updated (deprecated). <br> 
            Looking back there are plenty of things I would've changed about this project (such as the lack of comments) but I'm going to keep it up to see how my coding style has changed.
