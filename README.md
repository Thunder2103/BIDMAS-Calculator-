# BIDMAS-Calculator-

A BIDMAS calculator with a GUI - created using python and tkinter (a built in library no extra download needed)  
Indices have not been included but I plan to add them in the future. 

I attempted to incorporate software development methodologies such as DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and commenting less as in previous posts I put in too many comments to explain the program. I also expanded my knowledge on in-built python functions during this project.

Due to the large amount of combinations of numbers and operators I can't test for everything, it would be greatly appreciated if people could test this and report any errors so they can be fixed 

I've been unexpectedly busy with work over the summer so this project is all I've had time to work on but I'm pleased with the result. 
I plan to experiement with Machine Learning next or finish a few C# / node.js projects I've left on the back burner when college starts up in a few days.
